A weirdly hyper-specific tool for selecting arbitrary colors from the screen and comparing them in various color spaces.

### About 

So, you're sitting there, looking at somethin, and you says to yourself, you says: "how different are those two colors?" Now, as we all know, answering this question usually involves a long series of tedious steps. You've got to take a screen shot, open an image editor, eye-drop the colors, paste them into some website or program to convert between color spaces, then copy those values into yet another website or program to do the actual distance comparison. All this work just to be able to know, qualitatively, how different those two colors are. That's too much! 

**Color Distance Tool** is here to help. For just $19.99, you access immediate access to the RGB and LAB* values. But there's that's not all! As a special limited time offer, we'll throw in HSV at no additional price. That's _three_ color spaces for the price of _two_.
